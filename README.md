# Repository Notes

If you find a bug, file an issue! If you find a bug that you can fix:

1. file an issue noting what the bug is if you can. If you're not sure what the bug would do but
   know it's a bug, just skip to step 2, I'll handle the issue filing.
2. branch, commit the fixes, submit pull request.

Don't close issues until a release is tagged with the bug fixed. When a release is made with the
bug fixed, close the issue noting what released version has the bug fix in it.
